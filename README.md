# Underwater-Image-restoration-and-enhancement-using-Python

This project applies various image restoration techniques using OpenCV to improve image quality and restore visual clarity.

## Algorithms Used 

This repository contains Python programs for performing **image restoration and enhancement** using three algorithms:

1. **Color Balance Algorithm**
     Balances the color channels of an image, particularly useful for underwater images.
3. **Contrast Optimization**
     Enhances the contrast of an image using a linear transformation.
5. **Histogram Stretching Algorithm**
      Improves image quality by equalizing the histogram of the luminance channel.

## Libraries:

  **OpenCV** for image processing.
  **NumPy** for numerical operations.
  **Matplotlib** for visualizing histograms.
   
## Features
- Enhance underwater images with color balance.
- Optimize contrast with adjustable parameters.
- Improve brightness and contrast using histogram stretching.
- Visualize image histograms to compare results.
